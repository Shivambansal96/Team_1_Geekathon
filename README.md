## Challenges Faced:
Throughout the development of our Apple Website,  our team encountered various challenges and obstacles. Some challenges are listed below:

 **Challenge 1 - Complex Layouts:** 
   
  - Apple's website often features complex and dynamic layouts. Recreating these layouts with HTML and CSS while maintaining responsiveness was very be challenging.

 **Challenge 2 - Responsive Design:**
   
  - Apple's website is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. Ensuring that your clone is responsive and looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices was a significant challenge.


 **Challenge 3 - Interactive Elements:**
   
  - Apple's site incorporates numerous interactive elements, such as sliders, carousels, and dynamic content. Ensuring that with the use of innovative animation it makes the pages look like a replica of the main Apple UI especially the navbar with the drop-down and the sidebar.
      
 **Challenge 4 - Team Collaboration:**
 
 - Coordinating tasks among team members and ensuring smooth version control throughout the project proved to be a challenge.
