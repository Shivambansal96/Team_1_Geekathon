## Technologies Used

This project makes use of various technologies listed below:

- **Manifest.json**: Utilized in web applications, particularly in developing browser extensions or progressive web apps (PWAs), to provide metadata about the app like its name, author, icon(s), and version.

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language used to create and design web pages and web applications. HTML files structure the web content and layout.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used for styling the HTML elements on the web page. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed, controlling layout, colors, fonts, and more.

- **JavaScript (JS)**: A programming language that enables interactive web pages. JS is used to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
