## JavaScript Concepts Used

- **DOM Manipulation:** Manipulated the DOM to update the product list, shopping cart, and total price dynamically.
- **Functions:** Defined functions to add products to the cart, remove products from the cart, and calculate the total price.
- **Array Methods:** Used array methods such as `forEach` to iterate through products and cart items.
- **Conditional Statements:** Implemented conditional statements to check for existing items in the cart and to update the UI accordingly.
- **Template Literals:** Used template literals to generate HTML content with dynamic values.
- **Objects:** Used objects to represent products and cart items, making it easier to manage data.
- **Fetching Elements:** Used `document.querySelector` to fetch elements from the DOM.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Applied CSS classes dynamically to show or hide elements based on certain conditions.
